Life is too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you.If someone wants you in their life,they will make room for you.You should not have to fight for a spot.Never,ever insist yourself to someone who continuously overlooks your worth.And remember,it is not the people that stand by your side when you are at your best,but the ones who stand beside you when you are at your worst that are your true friends.
